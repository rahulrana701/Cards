We are basically making a project with go  in which we will be playing with cards , and in that project there
will be couple of functions to do the work . We can solve this project easily by oops but go is not a oops lan-
guage as in oops we could make a class of deck and create a instance of deck and define a string and place all 
our cards in it  and speficy some functions and manipulate our cards through that functions .But in go this 
can't happen.

In go we will be defining a type  deck which will be an array of strings and there will be bunch of functions 
made to use with it.
